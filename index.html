							<div class="ans fw">
								<p>The Fine Art DAO. ("We" or "The Fine Art DAO" ) exists to establish and operate an Art club with a Vault, Gallery, and a marketplace to buy and sell fine arts. TFA DAO plans to utilize cryptographically secure blockchain organization management tools to automate and improve transparency around certain aspects of organizational governance of the club's business, commonly known as a "decentralized autonomous organization" or a "DAO." </p>
								<p>We are offering for sale of digital collectibles ( a “Membership NFT”) on or about 1st March 2022: a “Global Membership” NFT (“Global Membership NFT”). The purchase of each NFT is a transaction in goods and not a promise to provide, or a guarantee of receipt of, future services from TFA DAO, although TFA DAO will make reasonable efforts to ensure that a DAO comes into existence which allows you to unlock expanded functionality associated with the Membership NFTs. Membership in the Art club will be subject to club rules, the terms of which will be determined if and when the club comes into existence in coordination with the DAO.</p>
								<p>You understand and agree that the sale of Membership NFTs grants you no rights and carries with it no guarantee of future performance of any kind by The Fine Art DAO. You are not entitled, as a holder of any Membership NFT, to vote or receive dividends or profits or be deemed the holder of shares of TFA DAO or any other person by virtue of your ownership of a Membership NFT, nor will anything contained herein be construed to construe on you any of the rights of a shareholder, partner, joint venturer, etc. or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to shareholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive subscription rights to purchase such shares of TFA DAO. TFA DAO may in the future offer holders of Membership NFTs the opportunity to participate in massively open online governance via DAO. You agree that the functionality of any DAO established by TFA DAO will be determined by TFA DAO in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
								<p>You understand that the development of TFA DAO's business is a significantly risky venture and you acknowledge and assume the risk that TFA DAO may not be able to complete, substantially or in part, the acquisition of an art club or any other aspect of its operations and furthermore that a significant proportion of the funds generated by the Membership NFT drop are expected to be retained by TFA DAO for any lawful business purpose. Your purchase of an NFT could lead to the complete loss of your money, and no payments will be returned. Membership NFTs will be created and delivered to any purchaser at the sole risk of the purchaser and on an "as-is" basis. Purchaser has not relied on any representations or warranties made by TFA DAO or any other person outside of the context of these Terms of Sale, including but not limited to conversations of any kind, including but not limited to whether such statements are made through oral or electronic communication, or any White Paper, social media post or website.</p>
								<p>The sale of the Membership NFT is governed by, and these Terms of Sale will be construed in accordance with, United Arab Emirates Law, without regard to conflict of laws principles. All disputes with TFA DAO by you or your successors or assigns directly or indirectly arising under or in relation to these Terms of Sale or the NFTS shall be brought and resolved solely and exclusively in final and binding arbitration in the United Arab Emirates, n under the Rules of the Land.</p>
								<p>CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TFA DAO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY A JUDGE OR A JURY IN A PUBLIC FORUM AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
								<p>Without prejudice to any other provision of these Terms of Sale, you acknowledge and agree that, except in the case of TFA DAO's fraud or wilful default, and except as otherwise required by any non-waivable provision of applicable law, TFA DAO Inc. shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever to you or any other person for losses or damages of any kind, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, arising from the sale of Membership NFTs to any person.</p>
